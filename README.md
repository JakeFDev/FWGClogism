# FWGClogism
About
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementing the Farmer Wolf Goat Cabbage problem using logism (logic gates and low level hardware)
This was created for CS 2521 at University of Minnesota, Duluth as a team project
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the circ file in logism. You can try to solve the puzzle while on the default sceen (the main circuit)
You must make sure that the clock simulation is on. You can enable it in the simulation settings, and
make sure the clock speed is above at least 32hz so the registers update fast enough for the game.
Press the buttons on the left to attempt the move. If you complete the puzzle, the "win" LED will light up.
